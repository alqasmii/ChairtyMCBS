## 🚀 About the Project

**ChairtyMCBS** is a charity-themed website, whipped up in a few hours by [@alqasmii](https://github.com/alqasmii) — powered by caffeine, chaos, and copilot-level help from AI.

What started as a *"let's see what I can do in one evening"* turned into something actually... *not bad*? Definitely more productive than scrolling Instagram.

🧃 Final Words
🚨 Built in hours. Judged forever.
🐢 Slow and steady might win the race, but I built this site before you even stretched.
